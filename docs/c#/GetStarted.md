# Getting started with Logger
_NOTE: Ensure you followed the correct installation steps in [here](AddToYourProject.md), or this tutorial might not work correctly for you._

## Instantiate the Logger class
Before you do any logging, you'll need access to the functions. Do this by instantiating a Logger object, like so:

```csharp
namespace ExampleProject
{
    class ExampleProject
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Logger logger = new Logger(); // You don't need to provide any constructor arguments
        }
    }
}
```
## Set the LogLevel
In Logger, everything you log has a level. You have five to choose from: `Note`, `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, and `Fatal`. In the code, these are reffered to as `Logger.LogLevel.name`, e.g. `Logger.LogLevel.Warning`.

It is reccommended to always set your Logger level, but the default is `Note` so it may not always be necessary. You can set the LogLevel with the function ` SetLevel(LogLevel level)`. That works like this:

```csharp
namespace ExampleProject
{
    class ExampleProject
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Logger logger = new Logger();
            logger.SetLevel(Logger.LogLevel.Warning); // Here, I'm setting a warning â€“ you can set whichever you need
        }
    }
}
```
