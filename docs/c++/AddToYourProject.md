# Adding Logger to your project

## Downloading the file

Adding Logger to your project is very simple. Start by downloading the file, you can do this by going to [c++/src/Logger.hpp](../../c%2B%2B/src/Logger.hpp) and clicking the _Download Raw File_ button in the top right. Save it to wherever you want it in your project. 

## Adding to your file

This is also very simple. At the top, with your preprocessor directives, add this line:
```cpp
...
#include "/path/to/Logger.hpp"
...
```
Notice how I included the path to the Logger file as well. Your path will be wherever you saved the file to.
